# Overview
main.py contains all the code we use for the competition.  The code is composed of three parts (1) DP primitives, including laplace mechanism and exponential mechanism. (2) Functions to process the data, e.g., reading the input data, truncating data, getting the sum. (3) Main body of our method.  We believe the code is highly self-explanatory.  We also provide comments for further explanations.  The privacy proofs and the intuition of our approach are in the pdf doc.  The code does not require extra packages and resources; it will typically finish within two minutes on a common computer.
